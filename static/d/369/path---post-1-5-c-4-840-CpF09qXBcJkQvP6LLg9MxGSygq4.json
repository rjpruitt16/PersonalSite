I believe the most import skills one needs to earn a degree is not aptitude.\nI have met people who were extremely smart to me, but drop out after one year. That’s\nwhy I was inspired to write this post about the 5 lessons I learned from my undegraduate\ndegree Computer Science degree.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Everyone is running their own race.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Stop comparing you failures to someone’s achievements. I started undergrad with the\nbelief that any class I applied myself to would always result in an “A.” Unfortunately,\nthat was far from the truth. Even worse, seeing people work half as much\nand receive twice my grade drove me to depression. What I failed to realize was\nthese international students were being train to be engineers since they were in\npreschool. Why compare yourself to someone who does not have the same background as\nyou. Of course, aptitude plays a role in every discipline. Work on what you are able\ncontrol and forget everything else.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Learn how to teach yourself.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Honestly, if you are Software Engineer, you must be able to learn new technologies\nconstantly. This also applies to the classroom. One professor often told me, “I am just\nshowing you what you need to teach yourself.” Spend two hours a day working on a side project\nor interview problems. The best part of life is being able to do something you love.\nFall in love with Computer Science by doing something outside of class for free.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Sharpen the Saw. (7 habits of highly successful people)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Working hard is important, but happiness effects your productivity. Take an hour\neveryday to do something that relaxes you. The gym at my college was the biggest\nreason I was able to graduate on time. To cope with the insane amount of hours I was\nspending alone to only fail the test regardless, I ran track, meditated, journaled,\nand played saxophone. Whatever helps you have the same enthusiasm to try again is\nwhat sharpens your saw.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of v ~ Winston Churchill</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Plan your day as specifically as possible.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I used to be against planning every hour of your day, but it is the only way I can\nget the most out of my time. Making decision is resources that weakens as the day progresses.\nDo yourself a favor a plan your day, even if that means planning your break. Doing more in\nless time will lead to a more fulfilling social life.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Be susceptible to change</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change. ~ Charles Darwin</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The biggest determinate to someone being able to finish college is grit. Being able to dedicate\noneself to a goal and adept to adept to overcome every obstacle to the goal is grit. Nobody chooses their\ncircumstances, but we can choose to make the most of what we have. I wish going to HBCU\nfor a Computer Science degree did not mean I would have suffer a lack of resources. Still,\nI could have taken free courses online when need.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I became serious about Computer Science only after my junior year. All of these\nlessons were only implemented after a extreme failure. After I failed to receive a\nreturn offer from my internship and my mentor told me he thought I was behind that I was\ninspired to learn Computer Science wholeheartedly. Better late than never. The most\nimportant things is I found something I love to do. Plus, I will be back at that\ncompany one day.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"5 lessons from my Computer Science degree","path":"/post-1/","images":["images/1.jpg"],"category":"Lessons","tags":["Computer Science","Lessons"],"date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","components":null,"tweets":null,"summary":"The five lessons I would tell myself before starting undergrad."}}},"pageContext":{}}
