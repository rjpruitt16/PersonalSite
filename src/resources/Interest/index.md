## Current location: Memphis, TN

### Interest
- I am currently looking for a Software Engineering job. Working in Seattle would
be nice, but I am open to work anywhere. I have been train by Software Engineers
from Google and Dell to write clean commercial code..
- I am looking for freelance developer work. I can build websites for your business
or personal brand. I can use your pictures to make the site, but I cannot take
take the pictures. The price will depend on what is ask, and I expect half the money
upfront.
- I would not mind volunteering with Computer Science. If you want me to come to
your classroom and teach a lesson on programing I would love to do it.
