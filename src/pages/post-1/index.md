I recently graduated from college, and I finally understand what it means to have a
degree. I believe the most import skills one needs to earn a degree is not aptitude.
I have met people who were extremely smart to me, but drop out after one year. That's
why I was inspired to write this post about the 5 lessons I learned from my undegraduate
degree Computer Science degree.

## 1. Everyone is running their own race.

Stop comparing you failures to someone's achievements. I started undergrad with the
belief that any class I applied myself to would always result in an "A." Unfortunately,
that was far from the truth. Even worse, seeing people work half as much
and receive twice my grade drove me to depression. What I failed to realize was
these international students were being train to be engineers since they were in
preschool. Why compare yourself to someone who does not have the same background as
you. Of course, aptitude plays a role in every discipline. Work on what you are able
control and forget everything else.

## 2. Learn how to teach yourself.

Honestly, if you are Software Engineer, you must be able to learn new technologies
constantly. This also applies to the classroom. One professor often told me, "I am just
showing you what you need to teach yourself." Spend two hours a day working on a side project
or interview problems. The best part of life is being able to do something you love.
Fall in love with Computer Science by doing something outside of class for free.


## 3. Sharpen the Saw. (7 habits of highly successful people)

Working hard is important, but happiness effects your productivity. Take an hour
everyday to do something that relaxes you. The gym at my college was the biggest
reason I was able to graduate on time. To cope with the insane amount of hours I was
spending alone to only fail the test regardless, I ran track, meditated, journaled,
and played saxophone. Whatever helps you have the same enthusiasm to try again is
what sharpens your saw.

## 4.  Plan your day as specifically as possible.

I used to be against planning every hour of your day, but it is the only way I can
get the most out of my time. Making decision is resources that weakens as the day progresses.
Do yourself a favor a plan your day, even if that means planning your break. Doing more in
less time will lead to a more fulfilling social life.

## 5. Be susceptible to change

> It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change. ~ Charles Darwin

The biggest determinate to someone being able to finish college is grit. Being able to dedicate
oneself to a goal and adept to adept to overcome every obstacle to the goal is grit. Nobody chooses their
circumstances, but we can choose to make the most of what we have. I wish going to HBCU
for a Computer Science degree did not mean I would have suffer a lack of resources. Still,
I could have taken free courses online when need.

Unfortunately, I became serious about Computer Science only after my junior year. All of these
lessons were only implemented after extreme failures. After I failed to receive a
return offer from my internship and my mentor told me he thought I was behind that I was
inspired to learn Computer Science wholeheartedly. Better late than never. The most
important things is I found something I love to do. Plus, I will want me be back one day.
